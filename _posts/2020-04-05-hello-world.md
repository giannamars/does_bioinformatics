Many thanks to [this marvelous guide by Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) for getting me up and running on GitHub Pages and Jekyll. To get started on bioinformatics, I will be following along with the [Bioinformatics Virtual Coordination Network](https://biovcnet.github.io/) as a main resource in this [world during a pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019).
